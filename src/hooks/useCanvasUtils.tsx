 * Hook to access Reaflow Canvas utilities.
 *
 * Those utilities are provided by Reaflow itself, and made available to all children components within.
 * Uses canvasUtilsContext internally (provides an identical API).
 *
 * This hook should be used by components in favor of canvasUtilsContext directly,
 * because it grants higher flexibility if you ever need to change the implementation (e.g: use something else than React.Context, like Redux/MobX/Recoil).
